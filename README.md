# MCS-253-VARK-PROJECT-
MCS 253 VARK MAJOR PROJECT 

Project title: VARK Questionnaire
   Learning Preference Method
   
Due Date: 6th of June, 2025

WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?

This particular project requires you to develop a Python program that implements the VARK (Visual, Aural, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic) learning styles questionnaire. Your program should take a user's responses, calculate their VARK scores, and then output their predominant learning style(s). This project assesses your ability to use appropriate data structures, implement logical decision-making, handle user input robustly, and 
incorporate custom error handling.

WHAT YOUR CODE COMPRISES OF:

HOW MANY FUNCTIONS?

There are 4 define functions

1. def__init__(self)

2.def__run__test(self)

3.def calculate_score(self, user_answers)

4.def interpret_results(self, scores)

WHAT THAT FUNCTION IS SUPPOSED TO DO?

1. def__init__(self)

The first parameter of __init__ is always self, which refers to the instance of the class being created that is VARK. It allows you to access and set the object's attributes.

2.def__run__test(self)

This function prints out the introduction, the questions with answers and taking in user's inputs.

3.def calculate_score(self, user_answers)

This unique function iterate through user's answers.

4.def interpret_results(self, scores)

This unique function interprets the results and determines the preference (V,A,R,K) and updates scores accordingly.

ANY CLASSES CREATED?

Yes!

The only class created is the parent class VARK.

IF SUBCLASS IS CREATED AND IF INHERITED FROM PARENT CLASS.

There's no sub class

WHAT DATA IS CAPTURED IN THE PROGRAM?

Data types captured in the program are:

1. String (.str)

WHAT DATA TYPE STORES THIS DATA? ANY DATA SOURCE?

1. Dictionary (.dict)

HOW YOUR PROGRAM HANDLES ANY EXCEPTIONS?

In this particular python program the occurs if the user enters a letter apart from A, B, C or D.

FINALLY, THE OUTCOME. WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME UPON SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF YOUR CODE.

The final outcome of this particular python code will print out the question and optional answers for any user to read (questions) and select (enter A, B, C or D) the answer of preference. Any choice apart from A, B, C or D will give an invalid error. After the user selects  his/her answer for the last question (Q16.).

The results of the VARK score that matches the answers will print out to show how many scores that matches the VARK for the user's answers. 
The interpretation of calculated results will the print out next. It basically interprets and tells the user what type of learning preference the user got from the results (it is determined by the maximum number of the scores calculated).

Finally, the interpretations of the VARK learning preference is further more explained in the last part of the output of the program.

REFLECTION: 

INCLUDE THE CHALLENGES YOU ENCOUNTERED DURING THIS PROJECT. 

The challenges that I encounter are:

Creating a code to concatenate the user's answers, if user has one answer to one question or two answers for one question.

Creating a code for an exception (error).

Creating a code to calculate the scores.

WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT, AND HOPE TO IMPROVE ON (IF ANY).

I've learnt quite some few coding and some ideas on how to create codes for certain functions. 
Here's some of the few things I learned;

Call a function and define the function with a unique name.

Applying some boolean function and data type.

Applying while-else function

Applying if-else function 

WORD OF THANKS.

I would like to take this time to make a word of thanks to this very significant people who helped in accomplishing this particular python program.

1. Mis. Komogi, MCS253 Lecturer for giving this particular task the helps us in getting to be familiar in using python program.

2. Mr. Neng, a second year student taking Bachelor of Science Education in Mathematics for giving me his laptop to compile my project.
